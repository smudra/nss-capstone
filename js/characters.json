            "description": "Dillon is a living electrical capacitor, powered by the micro-fine rhythmic muscle contractions that normally regulate body temperature. He can generate electrostatic energy at a rate of about 1,000 volts per minute and store up to 1,000,000 volts allowing him to emit lightning arcs from his fingertips at speeds of up to 1,100 feet per second, achieving a maximum distance of about 100 feet. In addition, he can override electrically powered devices and manipulate them mentally, travel along conductive surfaces (such as power lines) at speeds as fast as 140 mph, create electrostatic 'bridges' to travel varying distances and disrupt Spider-Man's ability to cling to walls. When fully charged, however, Electro becomes extremely sensitive to anything that can 'short circuit' his abilities, particularly water.",
